**Oh, no !**

All the cheese is gone... What will people eat ?! 
You need to save the world. Quick, take a space ship, and go to the moon, everybody knows that the moon is 
a big cheese waiting to be eaten.

Another problem, we don't have enough fuel for your trip, you'll need to stop in space satellites to fill up.

Be carefull, we aren't the only ones that want the cheese from the moon, so you may encounter bad guys...
